When I want to do at my home, I have turn left after exiting from my Technical University, and just go to straight ahead seeing local shopping mail, the church and supermarket on my way. Passing these places, I can see second campus of our Technical University and drive thru restaraunt. Finally I should cross the highway road and in 5 minutes I get home.
