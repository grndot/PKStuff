I could start this monologue from phrase "Life is good there, 
where I'm not", but i've never been in North Korea, and
i think life with Kim Chen isn't good, so i won't start
my monologue from that phrase, even i spoke it.
I think life is good there, where your current day is better 
than your past day, and your next day will be better than your 
current day. Human will be long live there, where is basic 
infrastructure: there are modern clinics, comfortable municipal transport, 
parks or  others green zones, supermarkets or grocery shops, 
even there aren't in shopping mall and may be something yet.
If that human have a family, in that list can add kindergarten, schools and
may be univercity. Some people prefer spending free time not at home, such
people can add theater, kinotheater or other places with enterthaiments
(for example aquapark or amusement park) in list above. If person is 
prefering healthy lifestyle, it add in that list gym or sports ground.
I think i've said enought, because that's all.
