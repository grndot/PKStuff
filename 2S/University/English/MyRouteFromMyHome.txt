I was thinking: what and where route i should take from my house
and I realized the next fact: i have to get lost from my house. 
To achieve this purpose i have to turn left after I left my house
and i have to go straight until i get to the road. 
If i will get to the road, i have to across street to the some 
college and i have to walk between that college and 
the wasteland. I will go between some houses and the some old bar
, until i get to the next road. When i get to the next road, 
i have to go across it and go to the park, 
which will smoothly become a forest. When i'll enter to 
the forest, i have to take my phone out of my pocket and 
i should pay attention to the communicaton indicator: 
if that indicator displays LTE my purpose hasn't been achieved 
and i have to go straight yet and when communication indicator 
will display EDGE, my goal is close to me and when i won't 
can call from phone, my goal will done and i got lost.
